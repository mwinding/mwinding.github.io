I am a Research Associate at the [University of Cambridge, UK](https://www.zoo.cam.ac.uk/). I work with [Marta Zlatic](https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/group-leaders/t-to-z/marta-zlatic/) and [Albert Cardona](https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/group-leaders/a-to-g/albert-cardona/) at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology / Department of Zoology. My current work focuses on generating a complete synaptic wiring diagram, or connectome, of the brain of the fruit fly larva. Using this brain map, I hope to better understand how brain-wide computations generate behavior and how these computations go awry in disease.


**About me**\
I am originally from northern Indiana, where I received **Bachelor's Degrees in Biology** and **Studio Art** at the [University of Notre Dame](https://biology.nd.edu/). From there, I received a **PhD in Cell Biology** working with [Vladimir Gelfand](https://www.gelfandlab.org/) studying cytoskeleton rearrangement in neurons and oocytes at [Northwestern University](https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/sites/dgp/index.html), Chicago, IL. I also worked as a postdoc studying how innate and learned valences are integrated in the *Drosophila* larva brain at [Janelia Research Campus, HHMI](https://www.janelia.org/) in Ashburn, Virginia.
